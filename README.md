### Abstract
 I decided to make the Movie app to use the new technologies of Android and improve myself. When I started doing this application, there were technologies that I used for the first time. This situation forced me a lot. I got involved in continuous research and received help from various question and answer platforms. I would like to thank everyone separately. I am sharing this project with you as open source. If you have a chance to review the code structure, don't forget to send your advice to me. When I finished this project, I learned very good experiences. This made me very happy. Now I started to roll up my sleeves to start my next project.

### Project Details
In the making of this movies app, I developed it using the APIs presented in TheMovieDB, when we log in to the application, we first encounter the main page. Here, the popular and upcoming movies are listed and when we click, we get the details of the movie. We reach the movies with the most votes from the tab next to it. By coming to the search option, we can search the movies database. And finally, we can go into details and see the movies we have added to favorites.
### How Can I Use
If you want to use this project, all you have to do is 
```
/util/Constant/
API_KEY = "Your API KEY"
```
you can follow this path and use the API you obtained from [TheMovieDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/).
